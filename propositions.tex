``\textbf{B vitamins and DNA methylation in colorectal carcinogenesis:\\across a continuum of differential risk for colorectal cancer}''\\

\noindent
1.	Folic acid supplementation does not affect leukocyte global DNA methylation in older and healthy individuals (\emph{this thesis}).\\
\quad\\
2.	Plasma folate concentrations only influence LINE-1 DNA methylation in patients who already have a colorectal adenoma (\emph{this thesis}).\\
\quad\\
3.	Given that DNA hypomethylation seems to increase with age, reversion of global DNA hypomethylation by folic acid supplementation may be more difficult and may take longer in older individuals (\emph{this thesis}).\\
\quad\\
4.	Comparisons between studies are challenging when different methods and surrogates are used to measure global DNA methylation (\emph{this thesis}).\\
\quad\\
5.	Our results and those of others taken together would not support revisions to the current recommendation of eating a variety of plant-based foods as set by the WCRF/AICR (\emph{this thesis}).\\
\quad\\
6.	You can make a leg stronger by breaking it.\\
\quad\\
7.	Cross-cultural individuals build relationships easily with people of any culture but do not have a sense of fully belonging to any one single culture.\\
\quad\\
8.	More important than desire for scientific knowledge, good coping mechanisms against frustration and loneliness help propel a PhD project forwards towards completion.\\
\quad\\
9. ``Hoe laat is het?" Being late in the Netherlands is so objectionable that asking what time it is in Dutch probably assumes you are already late and therefore motivates you to hurry up.\\
\quad\\
10.	There is greater instant gratification in writing a good proposition than in writing a good thesis.\\
